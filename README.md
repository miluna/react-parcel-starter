This script initializes a React project with <strong>react, react-dom and react-router as dependencies</strong> relying in Parcel to bundle the project.

## Requirements

You will need to install <strong>Parcel</strong> if you haven't already. You can run the following command:

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Please make sure you run the script using a <strong>Linux/Mac/Git Bash terminal</strong> as it is a Shell script.
